Unfortunately, I was not able to implement the project completely.
There is no Node_Modules folder in the repository. It will be added after executing the npm install command. I managed to download a file from the local file (csv) system. But after that I was able to output its contents only to the console. Therefore, an array with static data is output to the page (just for example).
I think I don't have enough experience working on JavaScript and Vue.js. But I think that exactly these technologies I would like to study and use in my future work.
